### Emergency Help
The skill now has a feature that allows you to ask Alice for help if you have fallen and can't get back up to grab your phone etc

To use this feature:

From the skill settings...
- In the emergency contact list, add your contacts username/chatId. You can add as many as you like, just seperate them with a comma, 
example : Sue/12345678, Bob/87654321
- Enable "Confirm Emergency call" if you'd like to be asked confirmation regarding sending a emergency message.

If the unfortunate happens and you take a fall or need help. You can now ask Alice things such as :
- help me please
- Will you help me ?
- Help, call my emergency contact
